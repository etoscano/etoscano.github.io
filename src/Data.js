The three activities proposed are based on real laboratory activities that children do in a local specialized center. An image shows the configuration of the the smart room environment. The images above show some components used to build the pyramid smart object and the smart room at i3lab, where we tested the games. The interaction for the first two games is based on hand tracking while the third game relies on the pyramid smart object. My team and I have created a pyramid smart object for one of the games. Inside the smart room there were the frontal and the floor projections.`,

        The user uses their smartphone to interact with physical objects.
        First the user scans the interactive city that they want to learn about, on the world map.
        Then, the city is loaded on a cube.
        The user uses a handmade paper cube as medium through which interact with the information available about the city.
        <br/><b>Each side of the cube shows a different aspect the user may want to learn about, such as monuments, state anthems and flags.</b>
        The online database allows other users to "see" what is loaded on a certain cube, making a <b>shared learning experience</b> possible.
        Also, placing two cubes close to each other allows the user to learn about the differences between the two countries.
